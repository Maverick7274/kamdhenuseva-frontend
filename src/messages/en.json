Krishna's friends, the cows, find shelter and love in this blessed place.\n\nIn the ancient city of Vrindavan, on the banks of the sacred Yamuna River, there is an Ashram of the world-famous sage Sri Devraha Baba, one of the greatest siddha yogis of India in the parampara of Sri Ramanuja Acharya. People of all castes and classes came to him to pay obeisances from different parts of India and many countries of the world. It was attended by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv, the first President of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev, as well as other politicians, saints, yogis, priests, rich and poor—all came for the blessing of Sri Devraha Baba—the true spiritual incarnation of love.\n\nToday, the ashram is run by the successor of Sri Devraha Baba, Mahatma Sri Devadas Maharaj, following the instructions of the great sage."
